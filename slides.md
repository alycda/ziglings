Speaker Notes
===

`presenterm` supports speaker notes.

You can use the following HTML comment throughout your presentation markdown file:

```markdown
<!-- speaker_note: Your speaker note goes here. -->
```

<!-- speaker_note: This is a speaker note from slide 1. -->

And you can run a separate instance of `presenterm` to view them.

<!-- speaker_note: You can use multiple speaker notes within each slide and interleave them with other markdown. -->

<!-- end_slide -->
