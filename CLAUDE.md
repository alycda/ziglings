This file provides context and guidance for Claude Code sessions

## Development Commands

### GitHub Operations

- **gh**: Always use this tool to view PRs, Issues, and Action Runs
  - Most repos are private, so web search won't work for private resources
  - The `gh` CLI is authenticated and provides reliable access to repository data

### Work In Progress

- **jj**: Prefer this over git but ask to make sure and remember for the rest of the session
